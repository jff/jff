## 🧠 About Me

My work spans from empirical software engineering methods that can inform practitioners and direct future research, to formal methods that can verify the 
absence of certain types of bugs. For more details, see my [personal website](https://joaoff.com).


## 🔧 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### [GLITCH](https://github.com/sr-lab/GLITCH)

GLITCH is a technology-agnostic framework that enables automated detection of code smells in Infrastructure-as-Code scripts.

### [SmartBugs](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs)

A framework to analyze Ethereum smart contracts for vulnerabilities. It integrates multiple analysis tools to provide comprehensive security assessments.

### [SmartBugs Wild](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild)

A dataset containing over 47,000 smart contracts extracted from the Ethereum network, useful for benchmarking and research in smart contract analysis.
